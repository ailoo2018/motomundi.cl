Step 1: Gather your Azure Information
First, you need the unique values Azure uses to verify you own the domain.

Go to the Azure Portal.

Open your Container App: motomundi-web.

On the left sidebar, under Settings, click Custom domains.

Click + Add custom domain.

Select Managed certificate (this is the free one).

Enter beta.motomundi.cl in the domain field.

Important: Look at the "Domain validation" section that appears. It will give you a Value for a CNAME and a TXT record. Keep this window open.
